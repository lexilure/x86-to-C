A scalar dot product, often denoted as "sdot", is a mathematical operation that combines two vectors to produce a scalar quantity. It is also known as the scalar projection of one vector onto another. The result of the dot product is a single number, representing the magnitude of one vector in the direction of the other vector.
The scalar dot product has various applications in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other fields. It is particularly useful in calculating angles between vectors, determining projections, and finding the component of one vector in the direction of another.

The program will compare the results of the sdot in both debug and release
